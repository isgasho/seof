# go seof: Simple Encrypted os.File

Encrypted implementation and drop-in replacement of golang' [`os.File`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File), the file in
stored will have 768 bits of encryption (Triple AES256 -yes- very silly and very secure). The resulting type can be used
anywhere an [`os.File`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File) could be used. i.e. it can be both sequentially and randomly
read and write, at any file position for any amount of bytes, can truncate, seek, stats, etc.
i.e. [`Read`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.Read),
[`ReadAt`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.ReadAt),
[`WriteAt`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.WriteAt),
[`Seek`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.Seek),
[`Truncate`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.Truncate), etc.

It derives a file-wide key using scrypt with a provided string password, the file is sliced into blocks of n bytes
(decided at creation time.). Each block is encrypted and sealed using three AES256/CGM envelops, one inside the other,
achieving both [confidentiality and authenticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption). File wide
integrity is warrantied by signing blocks and avoiding empty sparse blocks.


Example
-------

Snippet taken from [base_test.go](base_test.go). Check the test files for more examples, i.e. Seek, Truncate, Stats,
etc.

```
    password := "this is a very long password nobody should know about"
    BEBlockSize := 1024
    data := crypto.RandBytes(BEBlockSize*10)

    // create, write, close.
    f, err := seof.CreateExt("encrypted.seof", password, BEBlockSize, 1)
    assertNoErr(err, t)

    n, err := f.Write(data)
    assertNoErr(err, t)
    if n != len(data) {
        t.Fatal("did not write the whole buffer")
    }
    err = f.Close()
    assertNoErr(err, t)

    // open, read, close.
    f, err = seof.OpenExt("encrypted.seof", password, 1)
    assertNoErr(err, t)
    readBuf := make([]byte, BEBlockSize*15) // bigger, purposely
    n, err = f.Read(readBuf)
    if n != len(data) {
        t.Fatal("It did not read fully")
    }
    if !bytes.Equal(data, readBuf[0:n]) {
        t.Fatal("What was read was not correct what was initially written")
    }
    err = f.Close()
    assertNoErr(err, t)

```

CLI
---

Usage, it can encrypt/decrypt/inspect files' metadata from CLI:

```$ ./seof                                                                                                                                                                                              ed@luxuriance
Usage of ./seof: seof file utility

  -e	encrypt (default: to decrypt)
  -h	Show usage
  -i	show seof encrypted file metadata
  -p string
    	password file
  -s uint
    	block size (default: 1024) (default 1024)

NOTES:
  - Password must to be provided in a file. Command line is not secure in a multi-user host.
  - When encrypting, contents have to be provided via a pipe file, while decrypting output is always to stdout.

Examples:
  $ cat file | seof -e -p @password_file file.seof
  $ seof -p @password_file file.seof > file
  $ seof -i -p @password_file file.seof
```

Inspecting metadata for an encrypted file:

```

$  Â» ./seof -p password -i img.seof                                                                                                                                                                      ed@luxuriance

Performance
-----------
Performance can not be expected to be as a non-encrypted file in a native filesystem. There is no performance
degradation beyond the extra work done by the encryption primitives plus the extra ciphertext size.

Internally, `seof` holds multiple unencrypted blocks in memory, unbuffered reading and writing should not incur in any
extra encryption work, and the typical sequential reads and writes should be performant and will not incur in
unnecessary encryption work or disk-input-output.

Because there is a limited number of blocks in memory at a time, random reads and writes outside the current buffers,
will trigger cache misses and 'expensive' encryption primitives (It does use AES which is hardware accelerated in many
platforms.).

Finally, encryption occurs in blocks, so changing just one byte would require encrypting and storing a whole block (i.e.
1kb). You want to tune the quantity of in-memory blocks when opening the file; and the block size when creating it.

Sequential reads/writes with an occasional seek should be fine. This is the typical user cases that is well satisfied
with just one memory buffer, and a file block of 10kb.


File Structure
--------------

- Header: (128 bytes, 120 used)
    - uint64 Magic
    - [96]byte Script salt
    - uint32 Scrypt parameters: N, R, P.
    - uint32 Disk block size
    - [8]byte zeros (verified on open)
- A block:
    - [36]byte: nonce
    - uint32: cipherText length
    - [disk-block-size]byte: CGM stream
        - the additional data for the AEAD is an uint64 holding the block number (verified)
- Special block 0:
    - uint64: File size
    - uint32: Disk block size (must eq to the header)
    - uint32: un-encrypted block size
    - uint64: written blocks (as in number of unique nonces generated)
    - []byte: Further metadata expansion

Syncronisation
--------------
Needs to be done.

Attack vectors
--------------

- Each time a new block is written, a new nonce is generated, less than 2^32 write operations should be done in one
  particular file (and key.). Internally the implementation uses buffers and will save (and generate a new nonce) only
  when the buffer needs to be flushed to disk (i.e. file closed, sync or cache removal.)
  if your application does a lots of random seeks and writes (constantly invalidating the blocks cache, forcing flushing
  blocks to disk, generating new nonces for the new encrypted block) you might hit that upper limit. Block 0 holds a
  counter with the number of unique nonces ever generated (which equals to the number of written and encrypted blocks).
  This value can be inspected using the `seof -i` CLI command.

- The weakest encryption-link is the password string used for generating the 768 bits (96 bytes) of key. A string in
  latin characters should have to be approx. 150 characters in order to hold 768 bits of entropy. You have to keep that
  in mind.

- Blocks within the same file can not be shuffled or moved to another block as the AEAD seal holds its block number as
  part of its signed plaintext. This is verified.

- Most filesystems can handle [sparse files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file). seof supports sparse files, but
  read of never written/zeroed blocks is disabled by default to avoid a possible attack (see: XXX flag). User can create
  a new file and [`Seek`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.Seek) to any part of it, write a byte, and later read it.
  Reading outside the block boundaries of the unique written byte will fail unless explicitly enabled. This is not a
  very typical user case.

  __Long explanation__: in order to keep track of blocks holding data, seof should keep a block-written-bitmap. So when
  a block is read from the disk and comes completely empty (zeroed, no AEAD seal present), but the block-written-bitmap
  accuses it was written previously, it is fair to assume the data has been lost, therefore deemed inconsistent, an IO
  error should be raised (it could have been zeroed by a malicious actor, too.). Without this block-written-bitmap, a
  zeroed block by a malicious actor and an honest empty blob in a sparse file are indistinguishable, potentially
  allowing a "selective block zero-ing attack." and failing the integrity assurances.

  If you really need this assurance, let me know, the block-written-bitmap can be done.
